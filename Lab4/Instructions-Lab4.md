# Lecture 4 Lab Exercises

## Program 1

Create a flowchart to determine if a person can drive with or without a fully qualified driver. 

*NOTE: Drivers with a provisional license must have a fully qualified driver to travel with them. Drivers with a full license can drive alone,).*

Display an appropriate message to the screen indicating whether they can or cannot drive alone.

***Save this flowchart on your OneDrive within the Java/Lecture 4 folder as `F1Drive.doc`***

Write a program to solve the above problem. 

***Save this program on your OneDrive within the Java/Lecture 4 folder as `P1Drive.java`***

## Program 2

The Student Union is organising a student trip and they are determining how many cars are required. 
Prompt the user to enter the total number of students going on the trip.
Then determine how many cars are required (5 to a car) and how many students are left without transport.

***Use pseudocode to design the program using MS word and save it as `F2Trip.doc`***

Write a program using the pseudocode from the problem above.

***Save this program on your OneDrive within the Java/Lecture 4 folder as `P2Trip.java`***

## Program 3

Create a flowchart and write a program to determine the total price of apples. 
A greengrocer sells apples as follows:
    
    Less than 6 apples costs 0.80 euro per apple
    From 6 to less than 12 apples costs 0.70 euro per apple
    From 12 to less than 20 apples costs 0.60 euro per apple
    20 or more apples costs 0.50 euro per apple.

***Save the Flowchart as `F3Apple.doc` on your OneDrive within the Java/Lecture4 folder***

Write a program that accepts the number of apples bought and returns the price.

***Save the program as `P3Apple.java` on your OneDrive within the Java/Lecture4 folder***

## Program 4

Create a flowchart and write a program to prompt the user to enter a number between one and twelve. 
Using the switch statement display the corresponding month of the year back to the user (e.g. user enters 1 â€“ display January).

***Save as F4Year.doc and java as `P4Month.java` within the Java/Lecture4 folder.***
