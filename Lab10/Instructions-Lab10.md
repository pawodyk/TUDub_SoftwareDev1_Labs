# Lecture 4 Lab Exercises

## Program 1

Write an application that takes two integers from the user and display the **smallest**. In this program create a method called **Minimum** that returns the smaller of these two numbers. Create and add labels and TextFields in the constructor. Also add the following code at the start of constructor:

```
    setLayout(new FlowLayout());
```

Use Actionlistener and ActionPerformed to accept input from user.

***Save this program on your OneDrive within the Java/Week10 folder as `L10Minimum.java`.***

## Program 2

Write a Java method called **circleArea** which receives **ONE** parameter of type **double**. The parameter passed represents the radius of a circle. The **circleArea** method must calculate the area of a circle and return the result to the calling code. The area of a circle is calculated using the formula **&#960;r2**. (**Note: Math.PI** can be used to represent **&#960;** in Java, **r** represents the radius of a circle).

***Save this program on your OneDrive within the Java/Week10 folder as `L10CircleArea.java`.***

## Program 3

Write a Java application that enables the user to enter four integers representing the upper-left co-ordinates, the width and the height of a rectangle. Use Graphics method **drawRect** to draw a rectangle using the values entered by the user. Create and add labels and textfields in the constructor. Also add the following code at the start of constructor:

```
    setLayout(new FlowLayout());
```

Each time the user enters a new set of values, your application should redraw
the rectangle with the new dimensions.

***Save the program on your OneDrive within the Java/Week10 folder as `L10DrawRect.java`.***

## Program 4

Modify the application you wrote in *program 3* to enable the user to choose a rectangle or an oval as the shape to draw.

***Save the program on your OneDrive within the Java/Week10 folder as `L10DrawOval.java`.***
